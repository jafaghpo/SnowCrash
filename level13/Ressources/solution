first we will install peda to see better with gdb:

$> scp '-P 4242' -r ~/peda level00@10.12.1.133:/tmp

$> chmod 777 .

$> echo "source /tmp/peda/peda.py" >> ~/.gdbinit

We tried to run the program with ltrace and we saw that the program expected us to have the pid 4242.

We decided to use gdb to modify the return value of getuid before the comparison to "4242" happen.

gdb level13

we did "pdisas main" to see wich line we should jump to.

we then did:
$> set $eax=4242

and

$> continue
