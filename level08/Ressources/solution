We tried to cat token but didn't have the rights so we used ltrace like so:

$> ltrace ./level08 token

and saw a call to strstr but when we used an other file we saw a call to open and read.
We deduced that we had to find a way to rename the token file to read its content so we just did a symbolic link like so:

$> chmod 777 .

$> ln -s token exploit

and then we did

$> ./level08 exploit

to get the password to connect to flag08 and then we launch getflag.
