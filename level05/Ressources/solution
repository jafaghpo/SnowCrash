When logging with ssh we saw that we had a new mail, so we did cat $MAIL
and got: */2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05 which indicates
that a cronjob is running every 2 minutes and execute the content of every script in /opt/openarenaserver
we just did 'echo "getflag > /tmp/exploit" > test' and then waited for /tmp/exploit to be created.
