We see a file named "level02.cap" so we searched for the .cap extension and see that it is linked to Wireshark
So we downloaded Wireshark and used this command:
$> scp '-P 4242' level02@10.11.200.192:level02.pcap .
to copy the file from the vm.
Then open Wireshark, use chmod 777 on the file and load it.
We found "password:" on line 43 and we combined the ascii chars in the data section of the next lines to find the password "ft_waNDReL0L"
