$> cat token
we see a string with non-printable chars

Then we tried:
$> ./level09 token
and got "tpmhr"

$> ltrace ./level09 token
and got this:
ptrace(0, 0, 1, 0, 0xb7e2fe38)
puts("You should not reverse this")

So we understood that we had to find a way to reverse what executable level09 was doing,
and we probably had to do this process on the content of the token file

We understood what level09 was doing when we tried this line:
$> ./level09 "aaa"
and got "abc"

Basically the executable takes a string as argument,
parse it and display each char + a value i that goes from 0 to the size of the string

So we used scp to copy the token file to our session like so:
$> scp '-P 4242' level09@10.12.1.107:token .

and changed the rights with chmod to read it.

Then we created a C file that would reverse the process that level09 was doing, compiled it and runned it on the token file,
copied the result then did:
$> su flag09
pasted the result as password and finally we got the flag.
